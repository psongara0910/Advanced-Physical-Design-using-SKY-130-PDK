# Advanced-Physical-Design-using-SKY-130-PDK
Open Source Physical Design from RTL to GDS-II
## About The Project
OpenLane is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, CVC, SPEF-Extractor, CU-GR, Klayout and a number of custom scripts for design exploration and optimization. The flow performs full ASIC implementation steps from RTL all the way down to GDSII. We will be performing complete OPEN ASIC Flow on Reference picorv32-a RISC-V core.
